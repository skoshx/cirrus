- Plugins
  - Plugins work in such a way: Plugins are ever-present, passed to all functions `create`, `delete`, `createHook`, and then the plugin is called after all transformations are madeâ€¦
  - Plugins can insert ENV variables to all programs; for instance, if we have POSTGRES plugin, then maybe we have a `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` env variable passed to all programs. What ENV variables are exposed needs to be documented by the plugin.
